# thesisQuenches
Superluminal and hyperbolic quenches in the transverse field Ising and XXX Heisenberg model for my thesis

In both the TFI and Heisenberg folder:

    critical: used to calculate the critical ground state properties

    superlum or movingFront: inhomogeneous quenches are done in the models using a quench front moving at constant velocity

    hyperbolic: inhomogeneous quenches are done in the models using a quench front moving along a hyperbolic curve in space-time
